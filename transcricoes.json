I invited them to fly out to film a workout together, but at the last minute, said I'd like to blood test them with only 48 hours' notice. I'd have a medical doctor measure their testosterone levels, compare them to mine, and see whether or not they fall within the natural range. Let's start with Hussein. Everyone thinks he's on steroids because of this transformation, which took him just three years to achieve. Definitely suspicious, so let's see. Most natural lifters fall somewhere between 200 and 850 nanograms per deciliter. I'm at 470 right now. Guys who enhance will often go well above 5,000. Hussein came in at 689. Julian is a whole other animal though, especially at just 19. And going into the blood test, I was honestly very skeptical about his natty status. His testosterone came back at 672, and all their other hormones were normal too. It's always possible someone used in the past, but Julian wants to be Mr. Olympia one day, So if he really is natty now, we might look back on his physique and think, maybe he just was one in a billion.", "data": "2025-07-24 10:45:39"}, "2": {"origem": "microfone", "titulo": " Oi, tudo bom?
